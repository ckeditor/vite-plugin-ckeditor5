CKEditor 5 Vite plugin
======================

Integrate the [CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com)'s build process in your [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) setup.

You should use this plugin when [building CKEditor 5 from source](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/integrating-from-source.html) in a Vite application. It handles loading the `.svg` icons and styles from the packages and theme package. If your editor is already built (e.g you downloaded it from [CKEditor 5 Online Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/)) then this plugin is not needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental feature

Using this plugin to build CKEditor 5 from source in Vite is still in the experimental phase. We encourage you to test it and give us feedback. However, there might be some issues in more complex application/usecases, thus using this solution in production applications is not yet recommended.

## üìú Documentation

For an indepth documentation see the official [Integrating CKEditor 5 from source using Vite](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/advanced/alternative-setups/integrating-from-source-vite.html) guide.

### Quick start

1. Install the package.
	```bash
	npm install -D @ckeditor/vite-plugin-ckeditor5
	# or
	yarn add -D @ckeditor/vite-plugin-ckeditor5
	```

2. Import and use the plugin in Vite configuration.
	```js
	// vite.config.js
	import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
	import ckeditor5 from '@ckeditor/vite-plugin-ckeditor5';

	export default defineConfig( {
		plugins: [
			ckeditor5( { theme: require.resolve( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark' ) } )
		]
	} );
	```

#### Options:

##### `theme`

This should be an absolute path to the main file in theme package. Example:

```js
{ theme: require.resolve( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark' ) }
```

Note: If you are using this plugin in an ESM project you may encounter an error stating that `require.resolve` is not a function. In this case you can add the following to the top of your `vite.config.js` file:

```js
import { createRequire } from 'node:module';
const require = createRequire( import.meta.url );
```

## Known issues

- This plugin will not emit any translation files and only english is currently supported.
- When using the Export to Word or Export to PDF plugins the editor styles will not be automatically collected.
